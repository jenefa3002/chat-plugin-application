Client executive person can upload the documents up to 100 MB limit. \n Task Completion date will be mandatory. \n User can select multiple tasks at one time and user can complete the tasks by click on the “Submit Selected” button. \nUser can give remarks in the Remarks field up to 500 characters are allowed, which is visible to Concurring person/ Approving person during compliance Approval. \n If the Executive user completes overdue compliance by giving the completion date as after the due date and submits, a pop-up will arise asking for the Confirmation (Yes/No), if Yes, the user has to provide a password and the task will move to Concurring/ Approving person. \n In case of tasks being given as ‘Rectify’ by Concurring person/ Approving person then the same task will be sent back to the executive and the user has to do the required corrections as stated in the remarks and re-submit the task."
